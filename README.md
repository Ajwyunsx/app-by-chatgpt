# App By ChatGPT
### Android app that is built by ChatGPT from OpenAI

I decided to find out if ChatGPT can write a simple Android application.

I chose this task: to make an application that displays 50 popular stock market shares and their prices.

I stuck to those terms:
- Personally, I don't write a line of code;
- All I do is copy-paste what the chatbot tells me;
- I perform various settings as instructed by the chatbot (go through the wizard in Android Studio, get the API key in the service, etc.);
- If any bugs or bugs appear, I ask the chatbot and fix it the way it answers.

What I want to achieve:
- The code should compile;
- The app should run;
- Ideally, the app should display 50 popular stocks and their prices.

My entire conversation with ChatGPT took me 78 questions and answers. You can read the full conversation with all the answers here:
